Spiced Chat
=========================

This is my final study project. It was written in one week and my personal goal was to write everything without eny help (Google doesn't count), I just wanted to see what I can do by my self. I also wanted to practice **React** more because it's a trend and because I like it. I created a system where **Socket.io** gives you all information you need right after you registered/logged in and keeps the data flow in the background of web site, so it's faster then just normal "get" requests. And when you go somewhere on Spiced Chat information just appears. 

The idea is to create web site where all people from my Bootcamp could communicate with each other. On Spiced Chat people can use two groups of chats: global and team in which you study. Every group has info (for official information) and chat (for other things) rooms. So on the registration page you have to write a Cohorts (secret) code you got from your teacher. 

* Registration/login page.

* After registration you will go to your team info room. Here are messages from other people, list of available chats, info about where you are (left upper corner). You can add a message and everybody in this chat will see it in a real time. You also can click on people's info in message to go to the private chat with this user.

* Profile data window. You can change all your info here and upload your image.

* Private messages page. All people you talked to are on the left. You also can see the online indicator (this green/red ball after user name switches immediately after somebody logged in/logged out)

* In the right upper corner you can search for other people. Search works with First name, Second name and team name. Also it doesn't matter where searching letters are. For example here (next image) search for "rl" gives you First name "caRL" and team name "gaRLic"
